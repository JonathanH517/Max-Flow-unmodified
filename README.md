# Max-Flow-unmodified
Solve for the max flow given a series of struct data-- FROM, TO, and WEIGHT-- by using BFS and adjacency matrix.

To compile: g++ -std=c++14 -Wall -Werror demo_netflow.cpp netflow.cpp -o demo_netflow 

Note: the demo_netflow.cpp is where the main is at, and there will be input validations on the struct inputs
